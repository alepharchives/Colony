Colony is a small library that implements a simple thread pool in C.

API
===

It's designed to be really simple to use. There are three functions:

    thread_pool *thread_pool_new(unsigned short n);

Creates a new thread pool with n threads.

    void thread_pool_run(thread_pool *, void (*func)(void *), void *data);

Runs a function on the thread pool, giving data as the argument. This function 
is thread-safe. It blocks until the function can be started in the pool. To 
reiterate, this library doesn't implement a queue.

    void thread_pool_free(thread_pool *pool);

Frees the thread pool. If there are functions running, it waits until they 
complete. If you call thread_pool_run during or after a call to this function
then you'll be on the business end of undefined behaviour.

Build instructions
